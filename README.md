Project: Economic Development and Environment Pollution in West African Countries

### Dataset Description 

>This project is titled ***Economic Development and Environment Pollution in West African Countries***. The project looks at how economic development (GNI) affects the population and environment in 16 West African countries between the years 2009 to 2018. The economic indicator GNI would be used to check how economic growth affects population and environmental quality using environmental indicators such as Co2 emissions and forest area using West African countries as the case study.
.

>Data used in this project is from Gapminder which collects information about how people live their lives in different countries, tracked across the years, and on a number of different indicators. See a brief description below of each of the indicators used in this project.

1. ***Total GNI (PPP, current international dollars $)***: Gross national income converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity rates. GNI is the total amount of money earned by a nation’s people and businesses (Investopedia, 2022). This economic indicator is used to track a nation’s wealth from year to year.
2. ***CO2 Emissions (tonnes per person)***: Carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels (metric tonnes of CO2 per person). CO2 emissions are the primary drivers of climate change.
3. ***Forest area (sq, km)***: Forest area is land under natural or planted stands of trees of at least 5 meters in situ. The loss of trees and vegetation can cause global warming, desertification, flooding and other environmental problems.
4. ***Population, total***: The total number of people in a country or region.



### Questions for Analysis
1. Which West African countries are doing better than others in GNI, forest preservation, and controlling Co2 emissions and population?
2. Can the growth in population be attributed to GNI growth in these countries?
3. How have West African countries' GNI affected their CO2 emissions?
4.How have West African countries' GNI affected their forest area?
